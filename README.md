## Practice Logger

Website here:

This is a mobile site I developed for keeping track of my clarinet practice sessions. I use it to write notes, record the date and time, and natively record the video and audio of the music I'm playing. Upon saving the session notes and videos, the data is uploaded to Google Cloud so that I can hold on to past practice videos and track my progress.

In its current state, I'm able to keep a record of when/what I've practiced. In the future, I'd like to add another tab where I can set goals and view dashboards showcasing my progress (streaks, for example).
