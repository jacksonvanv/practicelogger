## Practice Logger

This is a mobile site I developed for keeping track of my clarinet practice sessions. Previously, I kept track of my progress through a video album in my camera roll. Each clip was unlabeled, meaning I'd have to listen back to each one to find the music/piece/session I was looking for.

With this site, I can write notes, record the date and time, and natively record the video and audio of the music I'm playing. Upon saving the session notes and videos, the data is uploaded to Google Cloud so I can hold on to past practice videos and track my progress. Immediately after recording, I've enabled playback functionality that allows me to re-record and override the current video.

In the future, I'd like to add another tab where I can set goals and view dashboards showcasing my progress (streaks, for example). It currently functions as a collection of practice session information with videos, but I'm exploring potential options to add some of these progress tracking ideas.
